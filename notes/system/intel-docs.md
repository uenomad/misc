## Intel documents

### Architecture software manuals

- Volume 1: Describes the architecture and programming environment of processors supporting IA-32 and IntelÂ® 64 architectures.
- Volume 2: Includes the full instruction set reference, A-Z. Describes the format of the instruction and provides reference pages for instructions.
  - Volume 2A: Instructions from A to L.
  - Volume 2B: Instructions from M to U.
  - Volume 2C: Instructions V.
  - Volume 2D: Instructions from W to Z.
- Volume 3: Describes the operating-system including: memory management, protection, task management, interrupt and exception handling, multi-processor support, thermal and power management features, debugging, performance monitoring, system management mode, virtual machine extensions (VMX) instructions, Virtualization Technology (VT), and Software Guard Extensions (SGX).
  - Volume 3A: memory management, protection, task management, interrupt and exception handling, and multi-processor support. This volume also contains the table of contents for volumes 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D.
  - Volume 3B: Covers thermal and power management features, debugging, and performance monitoring.
  - Volume 3C: Covers system management mode, VMX and VT.
